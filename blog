I took the fwitter CRM and turned it into something much greater. For starters, instead of having a user who has many tweets and tweets that belong to a user,
I have workers (the users) who have a lot of projects (the tweets), but the projects also have lots of workers. What this means is that you can have multiple 
people working on a single project and you can have multiple projects per worker. To accomplish this, I used a join table. On top of that, I thought that 
it would be interesting to have a Boolean value in my join table, so I used the Boolean 'leader'. What I used this for was that I made it so you could only
edit and delete the project if you're the leader. I also created a new function which is 'add'. What this does is that it gives the leader the opportunity to add 
other people to work on the project with them. Those people would automatically have 'leader' equal to 0, meaning they're not the leader (a value of 1 means they are), 
and a new element would be added to the join table. Finally, with the concept of creating new projects, I made it so that whomever made the project was inherently
assigned leader. 

One thing I would want to add in a future version of this is the option to opt out of being added to a project that a leader added you too.
