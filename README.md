# Sinatracrm

In this crm, you have a few functionalities that are common:
- Sign up, log in, and log out
- Edit project, create project, delete project
But there's the added capability to add new people. 
Once you log in, you'll be able to see all projects that you are a part of and can change the projects you are leading.

To start, simply type shotgun into the terminal and the rest will be self-explanatory
